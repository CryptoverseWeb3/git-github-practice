Click on the <a href="https://github.com/CryptoverseWeb3/git-github-practice/fork"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/G4z1kEe.png" height="21" width="21"></a>Fork symbol at the top right corner.

**2.** Clone your new fork of the repository in the terminal/CLI on your computer with the following command:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/cryptoverseWeb3/git-github-practice.git
```

**5.** Create a new branch:

git checkout -b YourBranchName
```

**6.** Sync your fork or your local repository with the origin repository:
- In your forked repository, click on "Fetch upstream"
- Click "Fetch and merge"

⚠️ **Make sure** not to commit `package.json` or `package-lock.json` file, until and unless you have installed the new packages.

## Style Guide for Git Commit Messages :memo:

**How you can add more value to your contribution logs:**

- Use the present tense. (Example: "Add feature" instead of "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood. (Example: "Move item to...", instead of "Moves item to...")
- Limit the first line (also called the Subject Line) to _50 characters or fewer_.
- Capitalize the Subject Line.
- Separate subject from body with a blank line.
- Do not end the subject line with a period.
- Wrap the body at _72 characters_.
- Use the body to explain the _what_, _why_, _vs_, and _how_.
- Reference [Issues](https://github.com/cryptoverseWeb3/git-github-practice/issues) and [Pull Requests](https://github.com/cryptoverseWeb3/git-github-practice/pulls) liberally after the first line.
